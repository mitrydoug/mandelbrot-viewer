## Mandelbrot Set

An interactive GUI for exploring the Mandelbrot set.

### Overview

The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex points that satisfy the following property: given a complex number ***c*** and the sequence ***z(n+1)=Z(n)\*Z(n) + c*** where ***z(0)=0***, ***c*** is in the Mandelbot set if and only if ***Z(n)*** remains bounded as ***n*** approaches infinity.

The Mandelbrot set can be visualized in the complex plane. Many visualizations color different "bands" of complex numbers according to the index at which the value of the ***z(n)*** sequence surpasses a predetermined magnitude (in our case ***2.0***); if the ***z(n)*** sequence for a particular complex number ***c*** attains a magnitude greater than ***2.0***, it is known that the sequence ultimately diverges. Here is the corresponding visualization:

### The Program

The program that I created allows for zooming in on particular areas of the the set and allows you to save images with a little interaction in the command prompt. Note: the color scheme can be changed by editing the function `generateColorScheme()`.

### Gallery

A small gallery of images produced with this application.
